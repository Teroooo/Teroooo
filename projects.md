  Mabula is a two-player board game where each player starts with 12 balls of their color placed randomly around the boardâ€™s perimeter, ensuring no more than two consecutive balls of the same color, even around corners.

On their turn, a player moves a ball in a straight line as far as desired, pushing any balls in its path, but without forcing any off the boardâ€™s perimeter. The game continues until no more moves are possible. The player with the largest connected group of balls wins.

Alternatively, players can score by multiplying the sizes of all their groups, with a maximum score of 81 (3x3x3x3).

  ## âš¡ Features  
  - ðŸ”¹ Board with Personalized Size
  - ðŸ”¹ Menu
  - ðŸ”¹ Save/Load Game
  - ðŸ”¹ Bot-Minimax
  - ðŸ”¹ "Page" with How to Play the Game
