  <hr>
  Mabula is a two-player board game where each player starts with 12 balls of their color placed randomly around the board’s perimeter, ensuring no more than two consecutive balls of the same color, even around corners.

On their turn, a player moves a ball in a straight line as far as desired, pushing any balls in its path, but without forcing any off the board’s perimeter. The game continues until no more moves are possible. The player with the largest connected group of balls wins.

Alternatively, players can score by multiplying the sizes of all their groups, with a maximum score of 81 (3x3x3x3).

  ## ⚡ Features  
  - 🔹 Board with Personalized Size
  - 🔹 Menu
  - 🔹 Save/Load Game
  - 🔹 Bot-Minimax
  - 🔹 "Page" with How to Play the Game

  DAP2 is a project focused on solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) through various algorithmic approaches. Users can select different datasets, including simplified and real-world graphs, to analyze route optimization. The system enables dynamic graph modifications, allowing users to test algorithm performance on altered datasets. It implements multiple algorithms, such as Backtracking, Triangular Approximation, and Cluster Approximation, providing different levels of accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, Proj2DA includes a specialized "TSP Real World" module that combines BFS, Dijkstra, and Two-Opt for enhanced optimization. A key feature is the ability to compare the execution time, cost, and path length of different algorithms, giving users insight into their effectiveness

  ## ⚡ Features  
  - 🔹 Dataset Selection
  - 🔹 Graph Modification
  - 🔹 Algorithm Execution – Supports multiple algorithms, including Backtracking, Triangular Approximation, and Cluster Approximation.
  - 🔹 TSP Real World – Provides optimized solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem using BFS, Dijkstra, and Two-Opt techniques.
  - 🔹 Performance Comparison
  - 🔹 User Interface (Menu)
